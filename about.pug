        <h2>Why Gym is important?</h2>
        <p>The first and foremost reason that gym class is so important is because of the physical activity. Gym provided us with exercise daily. While it may not of seemed like it, we became healthier, even if it was just the slightest bit. Along so, for the people who do no physical activity outside of school, they were now given the time to exercise. On top of this, so many of us take away something from gym classes. Whether it was a game that was played, a stretch, or anything, gym teaches skills that can be used throughout oneâ€™s entire life. It is not just physical benefits though, gym also gives us mental benefits which helps us think and function better in our everyday lives.</p>
